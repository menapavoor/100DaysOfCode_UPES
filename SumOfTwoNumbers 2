# Q2: Write a program to input two numbers and display their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
# Division by zero should be handled carefully.

# Taking two numbers as input in a single line
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Performing calculations
sum_ = a + b
diff = a - b
prod = a * b

# Handling division carefully
if b != 0:
    quot = a // b  # integer division as per sample output
else:
    quot = "undefined"

# Displaying result in required format
print(f"Sum={sum_}, Diff={diff}, Product={prod}, Quotient={quot}")
